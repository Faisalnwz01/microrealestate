## Debugging the application

### Prerequisite

- Docker and docker-compose installed
  > The `mre` bash script is uses for building, running the application. If running on Windows use `mre.ps1`.

You would need to have the latest version of [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed.

Then bring up the Debug view, click on the Debug icon in the **Activity Bar** on the side of VS Code. You can also use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+D`.

![Activity Bar](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/editor/debugging/debugicon.png)

### Clone the GitHub repository

```shell
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/microrealestate/microrealestate.git
```

### Go to the microrealestate

```shell
$ cd microrealestate
```

### Launch the application in development mode:

```shell
$ ./mre dev
```

Next, go to the debug bar:

Then select one of these values to attach the VS Code debugger to the application:

- `Docker: Attach to API` (Exposes the UI API and core engine)
- `Docker: Attach to Authenticator` (Handles the authentication)
- `Docker: Attach to Emailer` (Sends emails)
- `Docker: Attach to PdfGenerator` (Generates PDF documents)
